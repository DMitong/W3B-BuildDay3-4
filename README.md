# Colour Grid Project
## My Colour Grid is deployed to Sepolia testnet at 0x74E861FD80C748eA8A7EEf48c301B50b75397266

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract that defines a colour grid that calls specific colours whenever an x and y coordinate values are provided, and a script that deploys that contract.

There is an added project folder called **Project** which holds a React project that creates a frontend for the contract using WAGMI and Rainbow toolkit.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
